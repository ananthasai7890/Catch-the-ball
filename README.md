# Catch-the-ball
So this Catch the Ball project is basically a fun little Python arcade game made using Tkinter. The idea is simple: a ball keeps falling from the top of the screen, and you control a paddle at the bottom to catch it. Every successful catch gives you points, but if you miss, you lose a life. After three misses, itâ€™s game over.
